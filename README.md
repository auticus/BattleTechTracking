# BattleTechTracking
 UWP, Android, and iOS project for tracking a BattleTech campaign.

Currently only worked with the UWP portion.  This code was thrown together rapidly and deployed out in a couple of weeks.  As such, the best practices, etc... have not entirely been followed in lieu of getting a working prototype out.

Code cleanup and refactor should happen when the product is more stable.
