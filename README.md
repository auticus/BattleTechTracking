# BattleTechTracking
 UWP, Android, and iOS project for tracking a BattleTech campaign.

Currently only worked with the UWP portion.  This code was thrown together rapidly and deployed out in a couple of weeks.  As such, the best practices, etc... have not entirely been followed in lieu of getting a working prototype out.

Planned Releases:

0.1 - initial release with no server connectivity - can track a game

0.2 - server components added to sync up a game and allow a game to be tracked across multiple instances of the app

0.3 - quality of life and code cleanup / refactor

1.0 - final release - desktop app


INSTALLATION

Step 1 - Download the zip file.

Step 2 - Unzip to a temp directory.

Step 3 - The certificate must be installed on your machine before UWP allows the app to be installed.  This means double clicking the CER file and then installing it under the TRUSTED PEOPLE folder.  Failure to do this will result in the app not installing.

Step 4 - Double Click on the APPXBUNDLE.  This will launch the installer.

ALTERNATE INSTALLATION

Step 1 - Download the zip file.

Step 2 - Unzip to a temp directory.

Step 3 - Double click the InstallTracker.bat file which runs the installation via Power Shell.
