# BattleTechTracking
 UWP, Android, and iOS project for tracking a BattleTech campaign.

Currently only worked with the UWP portion.  This code was thrown together rapidly and deployed out in a couple of weeks.  As such, the best practices, etc... have not entirely been followed in lieu of getting a working prototype out.

Planned Releases:

0.1 - initial release with no server connectivity - can track a game

0.2 - server components added to sync up a game and allow a game to be tracked across multiple instances of the app

0.3 - quality of life and code cleanup / refactor

1.0 - final release - desktop app
